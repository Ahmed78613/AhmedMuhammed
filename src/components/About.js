				<h2>Ambitious</h2>
				<p>
					Ambitious, hardworking and a great team player. I look forward to any
					challenges that I am given. I enjoy working in a team and
					individually, despite any obstacles I may face. I am an organised
					individual who looks forward to learning new skills and growing as a
					person. I get along well with others and do not hesitate to ask
					questions about something I do not understand. My career goal is to
					work as a front-end web developer, the reason being because this is
					what I enjoy doing. All the way from desgining user interfaceses to
					creating them.

				<h2>Graduate</h2>
				<p>
					I am a BSc Computing for Business graduate from the University of East
					London. Due to my recent graduation, I am eager to secure an exciting
					role in front-end web development. In the second year of my degree, I
					undertook a 2-month placement as a WordPress web developer. I was
					delighted to be presented with the opportunity to utilise the skills I
					gained during my studies in college and university to bring a clientâ€™s
					vision to life. From gathering a clients requirements to translating
					them into a dynamic, effective and unique website with the help of my
					team. I am eager to hear about potential career opportunities, so I
					would be pleased to chat about job openings in the front-end web
					development sphere.
